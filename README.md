<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab Using Nessus</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  In this lab, I am using a Windows 10 VM to take advantage of Nessus Essentials and observe the count and various types of vulnerabilities that appear within Windows; as well as downloading deprecated software to see what additional vulnerabilities are introduced into the environment. A total of 4 scans are used in this lab: <i>uncredentialed, credentialed, credentialed after deprecated Software added, and Credentialed after vulnerability remediation.</i>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

-<b>VM Ware Workstation Pro 17</b> 

-<b>Windows 10 iso</b>

-<b>Nessus Essentials</b>

-<b>Deprecated Firefox Software</b>

-<b>Windows CLI</b>

## Configuring Nessus Scans
Nessus essentials comes with several different pre-configured scans but in this lab I will be using Nessus' "basic" pre configured scan.
