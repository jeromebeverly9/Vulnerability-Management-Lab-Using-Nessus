<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab Using Nessus</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  In this lab, I am using a Windows 10 VM to take advantage of Nessus Essentials and observe the count and various types of vulnerabilities that appear within Windows; as well as downloading deprecated software to see what additional vulnerabilities are introduced into the environment. A total of 4 scans are used in this lab: <i>uncredentialed, credentialed, credentialed after deprecated Software added, and Credentialed after vulnerability remediation.</i>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

-<b>VM Ware Workstation Pro 17</b> 

-<b>Windows 10 iso</b>

-<b>Nessus Essentials</b>

-<b>Deprecated Firefox Software</b>

-<b>Windows CLI</b>

## Configuring Nessus Scans and Results
Nessus essentials comes with several different pre-configured scans but in this lab I will be using Nessus "basic" pre configured scan. 

<br>-Basic Scan WITHOUT using credentials</br>

<br>-Basic Scan WITH credentials</br>

<br>As you can see, configuring a scan to utilize user credentials creates a vast difference in the types of vulnerabilites that are detected. Utilizing user credentials in the scan configuration allows Nessus agents to scan significantly more areas of the system resulting in more serious vulnerabilites being detected. The basic scan above only detected vulnerabilites rated as high as 'medium' while this scan detected multiple 'high' and 'critical' vulnerabilities</br>

<br>Credentialed Scan with deprecated Firefox Software</br>

Before running this next scan, I downloaded and installed a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox on my windows 10 VM. This helped to simulate the different vulnerabilities that can be detected by Nessus outside of only detecting Windows/ OS vulnerabilities. Of course, since this is very olde software, there was a significant increase in 'high' and 'critical' rated vulnerabilites by Nessus. Inside the 'Vulnerabilities' tab on Nessus we are able to see a detailed breakdown of the different types of issues that have been remediated with each version of Firefox. Some of these issues include MITM attacks, cross-site-scripting, and even features from Windows 10 like 'cloud clip board' that could have possibly recordered very sensitive user information (if enabled). It is also important to note that Nessus also list a majority of these vulnerabilites with its correspsonding CVE number as well. In this specific lab, to remediate the use of this version of Firefox I will simply be uninstalling it! In professional/ business environments, software updates are typically downloaded and tested by the IT team before they are pushed globally to every organization machine.

<br>Credentialed Scan after remediation and Windows Updates</br>

As for the last scan, this was ran after the deprecated Firefox software was uninstalled as well as running multiple windows updates to patch any outstanding OS vulnerabilities.
